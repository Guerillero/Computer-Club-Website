She can usually be found hunched over a lab bench or laboring under a hood, but when the goggles come off Bonnie likes to dabble in cooking and the visual arts. While her experience with computers is limited, she enjoys learning all that she can as a member of the club!</em></li>
                <li><strong>Public Service Coordinator</strong>&mdash;Thomas Fish<br /><em>Tom is a Senior Philosophy and Anthropology double major.
