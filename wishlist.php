It would be nice to have some to lend out.</li>

However, OIT later sold the drive array without consulting the computer club. Though the server was free, the server isn't very appealing without the drive array. 32-bit, single core processor with 2GB memory, circa 2005 at the latest. As such, we'd like to replace it with something more powerful.</li>
