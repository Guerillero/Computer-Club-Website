                <p>Immediately after last night's meeting, I erased the new website. Acting fast, I think I was able to extract everything from the unallocated disk space that contained the recently deleted files. If you notice anything missing from the website, please let me know. I recovered everything I could.</p>

                <p>I have rewritten the website a bit to make it easier to maintain. I also added some search engine optimizations to increase the sites ranking on sites like <a href="https://google.com/">Google</a>.</p>
